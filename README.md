# MI_SJTU_EEG

## Aspects
This project aims to study human-machine mutual learning mechanism including EEG processing and feature extraction and protocol design. Current Current research focuses on graph theory analysis of EEG-EMG functional connectivity. 

## Structure
- Model selection and evaluation of **Motor Imagery Recognition** is performed in Master_Motor_imaginary
- Multi-channels EEG-EMG analysis platform based on *mne* where functional connectivity functions and visualization methods are proposed in *EEG-EMG_platform*. Notably, in this folder, *EEG-EMG problem shooting* aims to break down the coherence calculation and interpret its implication. *firstCoRegistration_eeg* define the preprocessing pipeline and provides visualization tools.
- *paradigm_design* provides experiment instruction and GUI.
- In the Matlab folder, the .m file is an example script for Fuzzy model reference learning control.
