# MI_SJTU_EEG
This project aims to study human-machine mutual learning mechanism including EEG processing and feature extraction and protocol design. Current Current research focuses on graph theory analysis of EEG-EMG functional connectivity. This repository includes the following aspects:
- Model selection and evaluation of **Motor Imagery Recognition**
- Multi-channels EEG-EMG analysis platform based on *mne* where functional connectivity functions and visualization methods are proposed
